                    <p>
                        Iggy is a piano tuner, technician, and pianist composer based in Urbana,
                        Illinois. He learned to play the piano at a young age
                        and has accumulated intimate knowledge and great passion
                        for the piano.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a musician, he was greatly inspired by pianist
                        composers like Nils Frahm and Ã“lafur Arnalds for their
                        extensive use of preparation techniques and bold capture
                        of mechanical noises of the piano, leading him to
                        tinkering his own piano and eventually becoming a
                        professional piano technician.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Iggy is a member of Piano Technicians Guild. He works
                        with The Piano Shop in Champaign and has worked on
                        numerous pianos for institutions including Krannert
                        Center For The Performing Arts, University of Illinois
                        Urbana-Champaign School of Music, First Presbyterian
                        Church of Urbana, Channing-Murray Foundation; and for
                        many musicians and piano lovers in and around

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        <strong>Routine Tuning</span></strong> (every 6-12 months) is highly recommended to keep your piano healthy and stable - especially in the Midwest climate. The total string tension in a modern piano can exceed 20 tons! Regular tuning helps the instrument hold pitch, prevents large swings in string tension that can stress the frame, soundboard, pinblock, and preserves proper tone and touch balance.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        When a piano goes too long without tuning, it may require a <strong>Pitch Raise/ Pitch Drop</span></strong> before it can be fine-tuned. In some cases, it can take multiple visits to bring the tuning back to stability, which can increase overall maintenance costs.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        As a musician himself, Iggy is also happy to discuss <strong>Custom/ Historical Tunings</span></strong> that suit your musical style and creative needs.

                    </header>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Over time, dust, debris, and foreign objects can accumulate inside a piano, affecting its performance and appearance. A thorough cleaning includes <u>washing keys</u>, <u>removing foreign objects</u>, <u>dusting and vacuuming the action and soundboard</u>, and <u>polishing the strings and cabinet surfaces</u>. Regular cleaning keeps the instrument responsive and helps preserve its value.

                    </header>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        <strong>Tone & Touch Regulation</strong> is the detailed adjustment of a piano's action to ensure that every key responds and speaks evenly and precisely. It involves dozens of fine mechanical settings adjusted to specific measurements for each of the 88 keys, and requires specialized tools, experience, and a trained ear. Proper regulation restores the intended touch and dynamic control, making the instrument more responsive, expressive, and enjoyable to play.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Key regulation procedures include <u>key leveling and dip adjustment</u>, <u>hammer alignment and traveling</u>, <u>hammer blow and let-off regulation</u>, <u>lost motion & checking correction</u>, hammer <u>voicing</u> to balance tone and character, and more.

                    </header>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Most common piano repairs can be completed on the spot. Iggy provides a wide range of <strong>Field Repairs</strong> and <strong>Maintenance Services</strong> to restore the piano's proper function and reliability, including <u>restringing</u> individual notes, <u>re-pinning</u> loose or sluggish action centers, <u>repairing/ replacing broken action parts</u>, <u>replacing/ restoring worn felt and leather</u> components, <u>lubricating</u> key pins and pedal linkages, <u>tightening</u> loose bolts and hardware, <u>addressing noises</u> such as squeaks and clicks, and more - ensuring that the instrument continues to play smoothly and extending its life.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Every piano has its own personality and story, often requiring a thorough evaluation followed by a combination of services for the <strong>First Visit</strong>. Depending on the instrument's needs and yours, this process can take multiple hours and in some cases, requiring follow-up visits to bring the instrument back in shape. Each piano Iggy services receives the same level of care and attention he'd give his own - respecting its individuality while ensuring it performs and sounds its best!
